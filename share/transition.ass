; Your modification will be lost during the next update.

; To make your own transition template, copy this file somewhere else
; and modify it. Then uncomment the line `transitionTemplatePath` in
; `config.ini` and modify it to point to your new template file.
; Same goes for the transition background file, uncomment the line
; `transitionBgPath` and modify it to point to your new background file.

; We have decided to use subtitle files for text display with VLC
; because we can get a fancy output quite easily. Subtitles allow
; formatting and easy text positionning. We have used Advanced
; Subtitle Station Alpha format because it has some animation
; features and it is widely used for karaoke subbing. You should
; feel at home!

; You can use any kind of subtitle format for the transition template file,
; as long as VLC can display it. The template is handled in the Dakara
; code by Python Template objects, and song information are added by
; the mean of placeholders in the template. The available ones are:
;   title: song title,
;   artists: comma-separated list of artists name,
;   works: comma-separated list of works title, with work subtitle
;       in parenthesis and work link and work link number separated
;       by a hyphen; ie: "title (subtitle) - LINK_TYPE LINK_TYPE_NUMBER"
;
; The different placeholders must be preceded by a dollar sign, and may
; be embedded by curly braces. No single dollar sign should be hanging
; around in the template. For further information, please consult the
; documentation of Python Template:
; https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/string.html#template-strings
