; Your modification will be lost during the next update.

; To make your own transition template, copy this file with another name and
; modify it. Then uncomment the line `transition_template_name` in `config.yaml`
; and modify it to point to your new template file. Same goes for the
; transition background file, uncomment the line `transition_background_name` and
; modify it to point to your new background file.

; We have decided to use subtitle files for text display with VLC
; because we can get a fancy output quite easily. Subtitles allow
; formatting and easy text positionning. We have used Advanced
; Subtitle Station Alpha format because it has some animation
; features and it is widely used for karaoke subbing. You should
; feel at home!

; You can use any kind of subtitle format for the transition template file, as
; long as VLC can display it. The template is handled within the program by
; the Jinja2 template engine. Playlist entry information are added by the
; mean of placeholders in the template, which are associated to the data
; structure of the playlist entry:

; {
;     "song": {
;         "title": "song title",
;         "artists": [
;             {
;                 "id": "id of the artist",
;                 "name": "artist name"
;             }
;         ],
;         "works": [
;             {
;                 "work": {
;                     "id": "id of the work",
;                     "title": "title of the work",
;                     "subtitle": "subtitle of the work",
;                     "work_type": {
;                         "name": "name of the type of work",
;                         "name_plural": "plural form of the name",
;                         "query_name": "query name form of the name",
;                         "icon_name": "FontAwesome name of the icon",
;                     }
;                 },
;                 "link_type": "type of relation betwoon the song and the work",
;                 "link_type_number": "number of the relation",
;                 "episodes": "episodes where this song is used"
;             }
;         ],
;         "file_path": "path to the song file",
;     },
;     "owner": {
;         "id": "id of the user who asked this song",
;         "username": "name of the user"
;     },
;     "date_created": "date when the playlist entry was created"
; }

; Icon name can be used with the filter `icon` to get an actual icon (you have to
; set the font as Fontawesome). Long name of the link type is obtained with the
; `link_type_name` filter.
