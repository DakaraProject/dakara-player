; To make your own idle template, copy this file with another name and modify it.
; Then uncomment the line `idle_template_name` in `config.yaml` and modify it to
; point to your new template file. Same goes for the idle background file,
; uncomment the line `idle_background_path` and modify it to point to your new background
; file.

; We have decided to use subtitle files for text display with VLC
; because we can get a fancy output quite easily. Subtitles allow
; formatting and easy text positionning. We have used Advanced
; Subtitle Station Alpha format because it has some animation
; features and it is widely used for karaoke subbing. You should
; feel at home!

; You can use any kind of subtitle format for the idle template file, as long as
; VLC can display it. The template is handled within the program by the Jinja2
; template engine. Information are added by the mean of placeholders in the
; template, which are associated to the following data:

; {
;     "notes": [
;         "vlc version",
;         "dakara player version",
;     ]
; }

; For further information about the Jinja2 template engine and its abilities,
; please consult the documentation:
