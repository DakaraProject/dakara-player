# VLC hardware acceleration
# It is STRONGLY recommended to enable hardware acceleration if you run the
# server and the player on the same computer. You will experience unpleasant
# lags otherwise.
# You have to choose which hardware acceleration VLC will use, depending on your
# graphic card. Ensure that the corresponding drivers are installed on your
# system. Selecting the wrong hardware acceleration driver will result into
# laggy output or no output at all.
#
# For Linux:
# For Intel and ATI cards, use VA-API:
#mediaParameter = avcodec-hw=vaapi
# For Nvidia cards, use VDPAU which is chosen automatically by default. You can
# explicitely set it:
#mediaParameter = avcodec-hw=any
#
# For Windows:
# For any cards, use DirectX:
#mediaParameter = avcodec-hw=dxva2
#
# If for reasons you need to disable hardware acceleration completely:
#mediaParameter = avcodec-hw=none

# You can force subtitle rendering to use screen resolution instead of video's.
# This will enhance subtitles quality on videos of small resolution, but may
# slow down the rendering if hardware decoding cannot be properly set.
#
# On Linux:
#instanceParameter = --vout x11

# For other options, consult VLC expanded help for a complete list of
# parameters:
#   vlc --longhelp --advanced
# Not all parameters are allowed thought
# Some parameters only work on the instance, others only on the media

# Default is share/transition.ass
