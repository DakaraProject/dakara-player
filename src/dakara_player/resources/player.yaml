# Parameters for the player
player:
  # Name of the media player to use ('vlc' or 'mpv')
  player_name: vlc

  # Path of the karaoke folder
  kara_folder: /path/to/folder

  # Enable or disable fullscreen mode
  fullscreen: false

  # Parameters for VLC
  # You can pass extra options to VLC through the media and/or instance
  # parameters. Bellow are listed some common ones. For other options, consult
  # VLC expanded help for a complete list of parameters:
  #
  # vlc --longhelp --full-help --advanced
  #
  # Not all parameters are allowed though. Some parameters only work on the
  # instance, others only on the media.

      # VLC hardware acceleration
      # It is STRONGLY recommended to enable hardware acceleration if you run the
      # server and the player on the same computer. You will experience unpleasant
      # lags otherwise.
      # You have to choose which hardware acceleration VLC will use, depending on your
      # graphic card. Ensure that the corresponding drivers are installed on your
      # system. Selecting the wrong hardware acceleration driver will result into
      # laggy output or no output at all.
      #
      # For Linux:
      # For Intel and ATI cards, use VA-API:
      # - avcodec-hw=vaapi
      # For Nvidia cards, use VDPAU which is chosen automatically by default. You can
      # explicitely set it:
      # - avcodec-hw=any
      #
      # For Windows:
      # For any cards, use DirectX:
      # - avcodec-hw=dxva2
      #
      # If for reasons you need to disable hardware acceleration completely:
      # - avcodec-hw=none

    # Extra parameters passed to the instance (at startup)
    instance_parameters:
      # Subtitle rendering
      # You can force subtitle rendering to use screen resolution instead of video's.
      # This will enhance subtitles quality on videos of small resolution, but may
      # slow down the rendering if hardware decoding cannot be properly set.
      #
      # On Linux:
      # - --vout x11
      #
      # On Windows:
      # You should not have this problem.

    # Make VLC manage its own window
    # By default, a permanent Tkinter window is created and passed to VLC if
    # possible. In contrast, when VLC manages its window, it will create a new
    # one for each media, which may result in a blinking effect (especially
    # visible on Windows).
    # use_default_window = False

  # Parameters for mpv
  # You can define specific options for mpv from here
  # To get a complete list of the available options, consult mpv documentation:
  #
  # mpv --list-options
  mpv:
    # Enable the debanding algorithm.
    # This greatly reduces the amount of visible banding, blocking and other
    # quantization artifacts, at the expense of very slightly blurring some of the
    # finest details. In practice, it's virtually always an improvement - the only
    # reason to disable it would be for performance.
    deband: yes

  # Parameters for templates
  # Templates are used to display some information on the idle or the
  # transition screens in text. They can be anything the media player can handle
  # as subtitle, we chose the Advanced SubStation Alpha format as it is highly
  # customizable. Users can create their own files and place them in
  # ~/.local/share/dakara/playel/templates on Linux, or
  # $APPDATA\Dakara\player\templates on Windows. Generic files from the package
  # are used as fallback. The command 'dakara-play create-resources' will copy
  # the generic files to the user directory.
  templates:
    # Name of the template for the transition screen text.
    # This template displays information about the song to play (artist,
    # details, etc.).
    # Default is 'transition.ass'.
    # transition_template_name: transition.ass

    # Name of the template for the idle sceen text.
    # This template displays information about the player (Dakara version,
    # VLC/mpv version).
    # Default is 'idle.ass'.
    # idle_template_name: idle.ass

  # Parameters for backgrounds
  # Backgrounds are used during the idle or the transition screens. They can be
  # a steady picture or a video, anything the media player can read. In case of
  # pictures, they will be displayed for a certain amount of time. Users can
  # use their own files and place them in
  # ~/.local/share/dakara/playel/backgrounds on Linux, or
  # $APPDATA\Dakara\player\backgrounds on Windows. Generic files from the
  # package are used as fallback. The command 'dakara-play create-resources'
  # will copy the generic files to the user directory.
  backgrounds:
    # Name of the background file of the transition screen.
    # In case of a picture, it will be displayed during
    # 'durations.transition_duration' seconds.
    # Default is 'transition.png'.
    # transition_background_name: transition.png

    # Name of the background file of the idle screen.
    # Default is 'idle.png'.
    # idle_background_name: idle.png

  # Parameters for durations
  durations:
    # Duration of the transition screen between two songs in seconds, won't work
    # if the background file is a video.
    # Default is 2 seconds.
    # transition_duration: 2

# Parameters for the server
server:
  # Server address (host and port given at the same time)
  address: 127.0.0.1:8000

  # Server host and port (given distinctly)
  # host: 127.0.0.1
  # port: 8000

  # Use a secured connection
  # ssl: false

  # Credentials for server authentication
  login: login

  # Interval to reconnect to the server if connection lost (in seconds)
  # reconnect_interval: 5

# Other parameters

# Minimal level of messages to log
# For debug level, you can call the command with the `âˆ’d` flag to show
# traceback on exceptions.
# Default is 'info'
# loglevel: info
