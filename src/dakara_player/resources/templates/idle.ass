; We have decided to use subtitle files for text display with media players
; because we can get a fancy output quite easily. Subtitles allow formatting and
; easy text positionning. We have used Advanced Subtitle Station Alpha format
; because it has some animation features and it is widely used for karaoke
; subbing. You should feel at home!

; You can use any kind of subtitle format for the idle template file, as long as
; the media player can display it. The template is handled within the program by
; the Jinja2 template engine. Information are added by the mean of placeholders
; in the template, which are associated to the following data:

; {
;     "notes": [
;         "media player version",
;         "dakara player version",
;     ]
; }

; For further information about the Jinja2 template engine and its abilities,
; please consult the documentation:
