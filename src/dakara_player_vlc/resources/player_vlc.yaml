  # Parameters for VLC
  # You can pass extra options to VLC through the media and/or instance

  # VLC expanded help for a complete list of parameters:

      # VLC hardware acceleration
      # It is STRONGLY recommended to enable hardware acceleration if you run the
      # server and the player on the same computer. You will experience unpleasant
      # lags otherwise.
      # You have to choose which hardware acceleration VLC will use, depending on your
      # graphic card. Ensure that the corresponding drivers are installed on your
      # system. Selecting the wrong hardware acceleration driver will result into
      # laggy output or no output at all.
      #
      # For Linux:
      # For Intel and ATI cards, use VA-API:
      # - avcodec-hw=vaapi
      # For Nvidia cards, use VDPAU which is chosen automatically by default. You can
      # explicitely set it:
      # - avcodec-hw=any
      #
      # For Windows:
      # For any cards, use DirectX:
      # - avcodec-hw=dxva2
      #
      # If for reasons you need to disable hardware acceleration completely:
      # - avcodec-hw=none

    # Extra parameters passed to the instance (at startup)
    instance_parameters:
      # Subtitle rendering
      # You can force subtitle rendering to use screen resolution instead of video's.
      # This will enhance subtitles quality on videos of small resolution, but may
      # slow down the rendering if hardware decoding cannot be properly set.
      #
      # On Linux:
      # - --vout x11
      #
      # On Windows:
      # You should not have this problem.
